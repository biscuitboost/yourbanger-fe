# Audio Sample Files

This directory should contain sample song MP3 files for the marketing site.

## Required Files

Replace these placeholder references with actual audio files:

- `sample-rock.mp3` - Birthday rock song example
- `sample-ballad.mp3` - Wedding ballad example  
- `sample-country.mp3` - Inside joke country song
- `sample-pop.mp3` - Retirement pop song
- `sample-rnb.mp3` - Anniversary R&B song
- `sample-hiphop.mp3` - Graduation hip hop song

## File Requirements

- Format: MP3
- Quality: 128-320 kbps recommended
- Length: 1-3 minutes
- Size: Keep under 5MB per file for fast loading

## Usage

These files are referenced by the AudioPlayer component on:
- Homepage (3 samples)
- Examples page (6 samples)

## Placeholder

Until real audio files are added, the audio players will show but won't play audio. The UI and functionality are ready to go once you add the MP3 files.
