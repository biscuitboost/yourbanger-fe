# Assets To-Do List

These assets need to be created and added to the `/public` directory:

## Images

### Social Media / SEO
- [ ] `og-image.jpg` (1200x628px) - Open Graph image for social sharing
  - Should feature YourBanger branding
  - Include tagline: "Turn Your Story Into a Song"
  - Purple/pink gradient theme

### Branding
- [ ] `favicon.svg` - Site favicon with YourBanger logo
- [ ] `logo.png` - Full logo for various uses
- [ ] `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180px) - iOS home screen icon

## Audio Files (see `/public/audio/README.md`)
- [ ] 6 sample song MP3 files

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Hero section background image or illustration
- [ ] Use case illustrations (birthday, wedding, etc.)
- [ ] Customer testimonial photos (optional)

## Current Status

The site is functional without these assets but will use:
- Default favicon
- Text-only logo (🎵 YourBanger)
- Default OG image (will need to be created)
- Audio players without actual audio (UI ready)

## Priority

1. **High**: OG image, favicon (for professional appearance)
2. **High**: Sample audio files (core functionality)
3. **Medium**: Additional images for enhanced UX
