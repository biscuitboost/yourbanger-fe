- What you've watched them accomplish
- The growth you've seen
- Qualities that will serve them well
- Your hopes for their future
- Why you're proud (specifically)

- Regular check-in schedule (especially if they're moving away)
- Activity you've always done together
- New tradition as they enter adulthood

**Cost:** Varies
