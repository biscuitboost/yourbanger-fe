## The Best Anniversary Gift for Any Year

Regardless of the traditional theme, the best anniversary gifts share one thing: **they acknowledge your specific journey**.

| Year | Traditional | What It Really Needs |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Any | See above | Something that proves you remember |
