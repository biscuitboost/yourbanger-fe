## The "Has Everything" Problem

You know the person. They have money. They buy what they want when they want it. Every time you ask what they'd like, they say "Oh, nothing—I don't need anything."

And they mean it. They genuinely don't need another thing.

So what do you get someone who has everything?

**You get them something money can't easily buy: something personal.**

## 10 Perfect Gifts for People Who Have Everything

### 1. A Custom Song About Your Relationship

<!-- IMAGE: Person looking surprised and touched while listening to something on their phone -->
<!-- Alt text: "Wealthy adult emotionally moved by receiving a personalized songs" -->

**Why it works for "has everything" people:** They can buy any song on iTunes. They cannot buy a song that's literally about them.

**What it is:** A professionally produced song with custom lyrics about them—their quirks, your shared memories, inside jokes. [YourBanger.com](/) creates these in about 2 minutes.

**The pitch:** "I know you don't need anything. So I made you something that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world."

**Cost:** $19.99

> "My dad has everything. Literally everything. I made him a song about his golf obsession and our camping trips. He's played it for every person who's visited in the last month." — Michael T.

### 2. Your Time (Specifically Scheduled)

**Why it works:** People who have everything often lack uninterrupted time with people they love.

**What it is:** Not a vague "let's hang out sometime" but a concrete plan. Tickets already bought. Reservation already made. Day blocked off.

**Examples:**
- A cooking class together
- A day trip with no agenda
- A "tech-free" afternoon doing something they mentioned once

**Cost:** Varies (the specificity is the gift)

### 3. A Problem Solved

**Why it works:** Wealthy people still have problems. Things that annoy them. Tasks they never get around to.

**What it is:** Figure out what irritates them and fix it. Organize their garage. Set up that tech thing they've been avoiding. Handle the thing they've been procrastinating.

**The key:** Don't ask permission. Just do it (if you know them well enough).

**Cost:** Your time + possibly supplies

### 4. A Memory Documented

**Why it works:** They have stuff. But have they captured the story behind the stuff?

**What it is:**
- Interview their parents about their childhood before those stories are gone
- Compile their best photos with real commentary
- Write down family recipes in their grandmother's handwriting

**Cost:** Free to $100+ (depending on how fancy you get)

### 5. A Charitable Gift That Reflects Them

**Why it works:** They don't need more things. But they might care about causes.

**What it is:** A meaningful donation in their name to something they actually care about. Not generic—specific to their values.

**The upgrade:** Do something active, like "I sponsored a family in your name and here are their letters" or "I funded a classroom project about [their profession]."

**Cost:** Varies

### 6. Something Handmade (Even If You're Bad At It)

<!-- IMAGE: Imperfect but heartfelt handmade gift - perhaps a hand-painted card or simple crafted item -->
<!-- Alt text: "Handmade gift with imperfect but heartfelt craftsmanship" -->

**Why it works:** They can buy professional quality. They can't buy something made by your hands.

**What it is:** A painting. A poem. A knitted scarf (even a lumpy one). A woodworking project.

**The secret:** The imperfection is part of the value. It shows time invested.

**Cost:** Supplies only

### 7. Access to Something Exclusive

**Why it works:** People who have everything have likely bought the "normal" version. They haven't accessed the special version.

**What it is:**
- Behind-the-scenes tour of something they love
- A private lesson from an expert in their hobby
- Access to a members-only event or location

**The key:** Research what they love, then find the "insider" version of it.

**Cost:** Often less than you'd think (sometimes just asking)

### 8. A Curated Experience Day

**Why it works:** It's not one gift—it's a day designed around them.

**What it is:** A full day planned around their specific interests. If they love coffee, wine, and bookshops: a morning at a specialty roaster, an afternoon wine tasting, and evening at an indie bookstore.

**The key:** YOU are there for all of it. Your time is part of the gift.

**Cost:** $50-200+ depending on activities

### 9. A Subscription to Something Obscure

**Why it works:** They've probably done mainstream subscriptions. But niche ones about their specific interests?

**What it is:** A subscription that feeds their obscure interest:
- Rare tea of the month (for the tea snob)
- Vinyl from genres they love (for the music person)
- Materials for their hobby (art supplies, specialty ingredients, etc.)

**Cost:** $20-50/month

### 10. A Written Testament

**Why it works:** People who have everything often don't realize their impact.

**What it is:** A letter, video, or book documenting:
- What they've meant to you
- Specific moments they probably forgot
- How they've changed your life

**Why it's powerful:** They can buy almost anything except proof that they matter.

**Cost:** Free

## The Pattern You'll Notice

All of these gifts share something: **they require you to pay attention**.

People who "have everything" in the material sense often lack:
- Quality time with people they love
- Proof that they're seen and known
- Experiences designed specifically for them
- Documentation of their impact

That's what you give them.

## What NOT to Get Someone Who Has Everything

- **More stuff** - They'll just have to find a place for it
- **Generic luxury items** - They already have the version they want
- **Gift cards** - Feels like you gave up (even if they're nice about it)
- **Something you'd want** - This isn't about you
- **The "upgraded" version of something they own** - Assumes they didn't choose their current one on purpose

---

## The Real Answer

What do you get someone who has everything?

**Something that proves you know them specifically.**

A [custom song](/birthday-songs) about their life. A day designed around their interests. A letter about their impact. An experience only you could create.

The gift isn't the thing. The gift is the proof that you paid attention.

---

## Ready to Create Something Unique?

If you're stuck on what to get someone who has everything, try something that literally doesn't exist: a song about them.

Share their story, quirks, and your memories. Pick a music style. In 2 minutes, you'll have a professionally produced track that's entirely theirs.

They can't buy that. Only you can give it.
