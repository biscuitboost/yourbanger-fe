## How to Pick the Right Unique Gift

Ask yourself:
1. **What does he talk about?** His hobbies, interests, mentions
2. **What does he use daily?** Upgrade opportunities
3. **What has he mentioned wanting to try?** His "someday" list
4. **What would surprise him?** Something he'd never expect

The best unique gifts prove you've been paying attention.

## The Most Unique Gift: A Song About His Life

If you want something truly one-of-a-kind:

A [custom song](/) takes about 2 minutes to create. Share his quirks, your memories, and what makes him legendary. Get a professionally produced track that's literally about him.

He can't buy that anywhere. Only you can give it.
