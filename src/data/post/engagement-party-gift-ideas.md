Someone you know just got engaged, and now there's a party to celebrate. But what's the protocol? Do you bring a gift? How much do you spend? What's appropriate for an engagement party versus the wedding?

These **engagement party gift ideas** help you celebrate the happy couple without the confusion—thoughtful options that mark the moment without overshadowing the wedding gifts to come.

## Engagement Party Gift Etiquette

Let's clear up the confusion:

**Is a gift required?** Technically no, but it's a nice gesture—especially if you're attending the party.

**How much should you spend?** Less than you'd spend on a wedding gift. $25-75 is typical; closer relationships might go higher.

**What's appropriate?** Something celebratory and couple-focused, but not a major household item (save those for the wedding registry).

**What if you're also giving a wedding gift?** That's expected. The engagement gift is a bonus, not a replacement.

## Celebratory Engagement Gifts

Mark the moment with something festive.

### Champagne or Nice Wine

Classic for a reason:
- Quality champagne they might not buy themselves
- Nice wine for a future celebration
- Champagne with flutes
- Wine subscription (first month or two)

### Custom Song About Their Love Story

A [personalized song](/examples) celebrating their engagement is unexpected and memorable. Include how they met, the proposal story, and excitement for their future together.

They can play it at the engagement party, during wedding planning stress, or save it for the wedding itself.

**Perfect for:** Close friends or family who know their story well.

## Engagement Party Hosting Gifts

If you're hosting or helping host:

### As a Host

## What to Avoid

**Skip anything too wedding-focused.** Save "Mr. & Mrs." items for after they're actually married.

**Avoid major household items.** Those belong on the wedding registry.

**Don't give anything that assumes wedding details.** They might not have chosen colors, themes, or dates yet.

**Skip gag gifts.** "Ball and chain" humor is tired and unwelcome.

**Avoid overly expensive gifts.** You don't want to overshadow the wedding gift or make others uncomfortable.

## Making It Meaningful

The best engagement gifts celebrate this specific moment—the excitement, the anticipation, the joy of deciding to spend their lives together. Think about:

- What would help them enjoy this engagement period?
- What captures the excitement of this moment?
- What would they treasure as a memory of this time?

A [personalized song](/examples) about their engagement captures the moment perfectly—the proposal story, their excitement, and the journey ahead. It's something they can play throughout wedding planning and beyond.

## Final Thoughts

Engagement party gifts should be celebratory, thoughtful, and proportional. You're marking a happy moment, not competing with wedding gifts.

Whether you bring champagne, plan a date night, or [create a song about their love story](/pricing), focus on celebrating the couple and the exciting journey they're beginning.

They said yes. Help them celebrate that.
