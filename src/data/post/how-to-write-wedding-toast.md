## The Wedding Toast: Everyone's Nightmare, Your Opportunity

You've been asked to give a toast. Congrats! Also: terrifying.

Standing in front of everyone who matters to the couple, microphone in hand, expected to be funny AND heartfelt AND brief? No pressure.

But here's the good news: wedding toasts have a formula. Follow it, and you'll be the person everyone talks about—in a good way.

---

## The Basic Wedding Toast Structure

Every great toast follows roughly this pattern:

1. **Introduction** (15 seconds)
2. **Your relationship to the couple** (30 seconds)
3. **Story or observation** (1-2 minutes)
4. **What you love about them** (30 seconds)
5. **Message to the couple** (30 seconds)
6. **The toast itself** (15 seconds)

**Total time: 3-4 minutes.** That's it. Nobody wants a 15-minute monologue.

## What to Include in Your Toast

### For the Best Man

<!-- IMAGE: Best man giving speech, groom looking on -->
<!-- Alt text: "Best man giving wedding toast while groom listens" -->

**Talk about:**
- How you know the groom
- What kind of person he is (with story to prove it)
- When you knew he'd found "the one"
- What the partner has brought to his life
- Your wishes for their future

**One good story:** A moment that captures who he is—ideally something the partner has now experienced too.

### For the Maid of Honor

**Talk about:**
- Your history with the bride
- What makes her special (specific, not generic)
- How she talked about her partner when they started dating
- The change you've seen in her
- Your hopes for their marriage

**One good story:** A moment that shows her character—bonus if it connects to why she and her partner work.

### For Parents

**Talk about:**
- Watching your child grow
- The moment you knew this partner was special
- What you wish for them
- The love you have for both of them

**Keep it:** Heartfelt but not too long. You'll cry. That's okay.

## What to Avoid in a Wedding Toast

<!-- Alt text: "Wedding toast mistakes to avoid" -->

### Never Mention

- **Exes** - Not even as a joke. Never.
- **Embarrassing secrets** - If they'd be mortified, skip it.
- **How much you've had to drink** - Don't lead with this.
- **Inside jokes nobody else gets** - Maximum one, with quick context.
- **How nervous you are** - We can tell. No need to announce it.
- **The couple's fights or problems** - Keep it positive.
- **Inappropriate stories** - Grandma is in the audience.
- **How long you've worked on this** - Just deliver it.

### Avoid These Phrases

- "I actually didn't want to do this"
- "I don't really know what to say"
- "Is this thing on?"
- "So anyway..."
- "To make a long story short" (after a long story)
- "You all know what I'm talking about"

## How to Be Funny (Without Bombing)

Wedding toast humor follows rules:

### What Works

- **Observational humor about the couple** - Things everyone has noticed
- **Self-deprecating jokes** - Make yourself the target
- **Light roasting with affection** - Mock something they'd mock themselves about
- **Callbacks to things people know** - The quirk everyone has witnessed
- **Unexpected honesty** - "Let's be real, he called me 47 times after the first date"

### What Doesn't Work

- **Generic jokes** - "Marriage is like..."
- **Mean-spirited roasts** - Know the line
- **Bits that require explanation** - If you have to set it up for 2 minutes, skip it
- **Humor at the partner's expense** - You're welcoming them, not attacking them
- **Sexual humor** - Parents are present

### The Comedy Rule

One or two laughs is enough. You're giving a toast, not a standup set. Land a genuine moment of humor, then move to the heart.

## How to End Strong

The ending matters most. Here's how to nail it:

### The Transition

After your story/observations, pivot to sincerity:
- "But here's what I really want to say..."
- "All jokes aside..."
- "What I know for certain is..."

### The Message

Give them something real:
- What you wish for their marriage
- What you've learned from watching them
- Why they give you hope about love
- The specific thing you want them to remember

### The Toast Itself

End with a clear call to action:
- "Please raise your glasses..."
- "To [couple names]..."
- "Here's to..."

**Then stop talking.** Don't add more after the toast. End clean.

## Alternative: Let Music Say It For You

If public speaking truly terrifies you, there's another option: [a custom song about the couple](/wedding-songs).

Instead of a speech, play a professionally produced song that tells their story. It covers:
- How they met
- What makes them perfect together
- Your wishes for their future
- Inside jokes the crowd will get

You can introduce it briefly: "I could never say this better than a song, so I made them one instead."

## Sample Toast Structure

Here's a template:

**Opening:**
"For those who don't know me, I'm [Name], [relationship to couple]. I've known [person] for [time], which means I've seen a lot."

**Story:**
"I remember when [brief, relevant story that captures who they are]. That's [person] in a nutshell—[quality]."

**Pivot to partner:**
"When [partner] came along, I noticed something change. [Specific observation about how the couple improved each other]."

**The heart:**
"What I love about you two together is [specific thing]. You bring out each other's [quality], and it's something beautiful to witness."

**The close:**
"So here's to [couple]—may your life together be full of [wish]. Everyone raise your glasses. To [couple]!"

## Final Tips

1. **Practice out loud** - It sounds different spoken than written
2. **Time yourself** - Stay under 4 minutes
3. **Memorize the beginning and end** - You can use notes for the middle
4. **Look at the couple** - Not just the audience
5. **Slow down** - Nerves make you rush
6. **Have water nearby** - You'll need it
7. **End clean** - Don't ramble after "cheers"

You've got this. One toast, a few minutes, and then you can drink.
