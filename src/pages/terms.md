## 1. The Basics

Welcome to YourBanger.com. By using our service, you're agreeing to these terms. We tried to make them readable, but it's still legal stuff, so grab a coffee.

If you don't agree with any of this, that's totally fine - just don't use the service.

## 2. What You're Getting

YourBanger.com is a service that creates personalized songs using AI technology. You provide the details, we generate the lyrics and music, and you get a custom song.

**What we promise:** We'll do our best to create quality songs based on your input.

**What we don't promise:** Your song will win a Grammy. It's AI-generated and meant for personal enjoyment, not professional music production.

## 3. Your Account

You're responsible for keeping your account secure. Don't share your login info, and let us know immediately if someone else gets access to your account.

You must be at least 13 years old to use YourBanger.com. If you're under 18, please get a parent's permission.

## 4. Payment

Song gifts cost $19.99 per order.

Each song gift order includes up to 3 generations (6 track options). You select one final track to download and share via a gift link.

**Refunds:** If something breaks on our end, we'll make it right. If you just changed your mind after your order was successfully processed and the song was already generated, we generally can't refund it.

## 5. Ownership & Usage Rights

**Your content:** The personal information you provide (names, stories, details) belongs to you. We just use it to create your song.

**The songs:** You have the right to use songs you create for personal purposes. Share them, download them, play them at parties - go wild.

**Commercial use:** If you want to use a song commercially (in a video you're selling, as part of a product, etc.), contact us first. We'll probably say yes, but we need to know.

## 6. What You Can't Do

Don't be a jerk. Specifically:

- Don't create offensive, harmful, or illegal content
- Don't try to hack, break, or abuse the service
- Don't impersonate others or violate anyone's rights
- Don't resell our service or pretend you made it
- Don't use the songs to harass or harm anyone

If you do any of this, we'll suspend your account. Don't test us.

## 7. AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

Our songs are created using AI. Sometimes AI does weird things. We review the output, but we can't catch everything.

If your song has something unexpected or problematic, let us know and we'll regenerate it for free. We're not trying to create issues - we're trying to create laughs.

## 8. Service Changes & Availability

We might update features, change pricing, or modify how the service works. We'll let you know about major changes.

Sometimes the service might be down for maintenance or because the internet gremlins attacked. We'll fix it as fast as we can.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

(This is the part lawyers make us write)

We're not responsible for how you use the songs, what happens when you share them, or any indirect consequences of using our service. We provide the tool, you use it responsibly.

Our total liability for anything that goes wrong is limited to the amount you paid us for the order in question. That's fair, right?

## 10. Termination

You can stop using YourBanger.com anytime. Just stop logging in. Your account and songs will stay accessible unless you ask us to delete them.

We can terminate accounts that violate these terms. If we do that, you'll lose access. Don't make us do this.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We might update these terms occasionally. We'll let you know about major changes via email or a notification on the site. Continued use of the service means you accept the new terms.

## 12. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of Scotland, UK. Any disputes will be resolved in Scottish courts.
