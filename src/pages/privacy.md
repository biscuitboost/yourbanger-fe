## The Short Version

We collect the info we need to make your songs and run the service. We don't sell your data. We don't spam you. We're not here to be creepy. That's it.

If you want the legal details, keep reading. If that's enough for you, cool - go make a song.

## 1. What Information We Collect

### Account Information

When you sign up, we collect:

- Email address
- Name (if you provide it)
- Password (encrypted - we can't see it)
- Payment info (handled by Stripe - we never see your card number)

### Song Creation Information

When you create a song, we collect:

- The person's name you're making the song for
- The occasion, relationship, and other details you provide
- The lyrics and song preferences you choose
- When you created it

We need this to make your song. That's why we ask for it.

### Usage Information

Like most websites, we collect:

- What pages you visit
- What features you use
- Your device type and browser
- Your general location (country/city, not your exact address)

This helps us fix bugs and make the service better.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your info to:

- **Create your songs** - Obviously. That's what you're here for.
- **Run your account** - Login, manage credits, save your songs.
- **Process payments** - So you can buy credits.
- **Send important emails** - Account stuff, receipts, service updates. Not spam.
- **Improve the service** - Fix bugs, add features, make things better.
- **Prevent abuse** - Stop fraud, bots, and people being jerks.

We do NOT:

- Sell your data to anyone
- Share your songs with others (unless you share them)
- Send you marketing emails (unless you opt in)
- Use your data for anything creepy

## 3. Who We Share Your Information With

### Service Providers

- **Stripe** - Processes payments (they have their own privacy policy)
- **Hosting provider** - Keeps the website running
- **Email service** - Sends you emails
- **AI provider** - Generates the songs

These companies only get the info they need to do their job, and they can't use it for anything else.

### Legal Requirements

If we're legally required to (court order, subpoena, etc.), we might have to share your info with law enforcement. We'd fight it if we thought it was wrong, but sometimes we have to comply.

### Nobody Else

That's it. We don't sell data to advertisers, data brokers, or anyone else. Your info is yours.

## 4. Your Rights & Choices

You have the right to:

- **See your data** - Request a copy of everything we have on you
- **Correct your data** - Fix anything that's wrong
- **Delete your data** - Request we delete your account and songs
- **Export your data** - Download your songs and account info
- **Opt out of emails** - Unsubscribe from marketing (you'll still get important account emails)

To do any of this, email us at: **privacy@yourbanger.com**

## 5. How We Protect Your Information

We take security seriously:

- All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- Passwords are hashed (we can't see them)
- Payment info goes straight to Stripe (we never see card numbers)
- We use industry-standard security practices

That said, no system is 100% secure. We do our best, but we can't guarantee absolute security. If there's ever a breach, we'll let you know ASAP.

## 6. Cookies & Tracking

We use cookies to:

- Keep you logged in
- Remember your preferences
- Understand how people use the site (analytics)

You can disable cookies in your browser, but some features might not work properly.

We don't use third-party advertising cookies. We're not tracking you around the internet.

## 7. Children's Privacy

YourBanger is not intended for children under 13. We don't knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you're under 13, please don't use the service.

If you're 13-17, please get a parent's permission before using YourBanger.

## 8. International Users

We're based in Scotland, UK, but people from all over use YourBanger. If you're outside the UK, your data might be transferred to and processed in the UK.

By using the service, you consent to this transfer. We comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR for EU users.

## 9. Data Retention

We keep your data for as long as you have an account. If you delete your account, we'll delete your data within 30 days (except what we're legally required to keep for tax/legal purposes).

Your songs stay accessible unless you delete them or delete your account.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We might update this policy occasionally. If we make big changes, we'll email you and post a notice on the site. The "Last updated" date at the top will change too.

Continued use of YourBanger after changes means you accept the new policy.
