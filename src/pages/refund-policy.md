At YourBanger.com. we want you to be completely satisfied with every song you create. If you're not happy, we'll make it right.

## What We'll Do First

Before processing a refund, we'll work with you to:

1. **Remake your song** - We can regenerate with different parameters or styles
2. **Edit the lyrics** - Make changes to better match your vision
3. **Try a different approach** - Adjust the tone, style, or content

Most issues can be resolved by simply recreating the song with your feedback.
